# Trum

![Trum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macaco-maluco/trum/master/screenshot.png)

Web tool to practice drumming with electrical drum kits.

**Work-in-progress**, currently configured to work with the [Yamaha DTX430K](https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/drums/el_drums/drum_kits/dtx400_series/?mode=model).

To play without a drumkit, it is possible to fake MIDI inputs by using the numbers in your keyboard (1-9).
